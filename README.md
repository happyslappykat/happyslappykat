It's Always KATurday
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kat and I try to share all the good vibes with folks I meet. ðŸ“–
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automating the things, learning the things, securing the things, reducing pain for teams auditing the things
- ðŸŒ± The more I learn the less I know. Lately, it's K8s and its intersections with InfoSec best practices.

I've bounced around from Linux Admin, TechOps, Old School Data Center Work, to Devops, to InfoSec/Cybersecurity. Working on my second Master's degree in Cybersecurity now--first was in English Lit. Hit me up! I keep most of what I do close to chest for reasons.
